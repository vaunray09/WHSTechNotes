One game I really enjoy playing is a roblox game called Devas Of Creation.It has an amaxing world generation with multiple classes to choose from ,it is blowing up and becoming one of the most popular roblox games right now.The fighting mechanics are good and solo play is hard because of the classes some may have to rely on others for grinding or bosses which makes it very enjoyable.You can either craft or farm your weapons and buy or make your own potions de to it being a realistic rpg game.In this game you wont just be able to instantly become strong mobs do damage and bosses are quite hard to kill without learning their attack patterns.The map is big requiring you to get mounts unless you want to waste time going well across the map for a quest overall its a great game and i recommend it.

Without computer science many games that i play would not have been made due to the creative creators behind the game and this is what makes computer science so unique to turn a blank baseplate into something new and good and worthy of presenting to others and having them enjoy themselves.
